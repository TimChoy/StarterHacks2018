    <string name="about_us_body">Scavenger allows people to turn one personâ€™s trash into their own treasure.
        Users can upload, edit, or delete waste clean up projects nearby.\n\n
        Descriptions and pictures of the location/ materials are optional. Tag bottle refund programs as
        well as Personal Protective Equipment that may be needed! Users are encouraged to be physically
        active, clean up their community and increase the market value of their area. Scavenge with your
        friends for reusable materials, earn points for each completed task, and redeem them for coupons
        at your favourite local business!\n\n
        Visit recycling depots like The Beer Store to make extra cash too!  </string>
